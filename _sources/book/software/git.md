# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for source code management. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is essential for collaboration, version tracking, and maintaining project history.

## **Why Use Git?**

- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
- **Version Control:** Git keeps a history of all changes, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Branching and Merging:** You can work on new features or bug fixes in isolated branches and merge them back when complete.
- **Distributed Workflow:** Unlike centralized version control systems, every developer has a full copy of the repository.

## **Installation**

To install Git:

1. Visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions. During installation, you may be prompted to:
   - Set up your default text editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - Adjust your PATH environment variable (recommended).

### **Verify Installation**

After installation, verify that Git is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see the installed version of Git.

## **Configuration**

After installing Git, you need to configure some basic settings.

### **Set Username and Email**

Run these commands to configure your name and email (these will appear in your commits):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```

### **Check Your Configuration**

To view your current Git configuration, run:

```bash
git config --list
```

This will display all globally set options.

## **Basic Usage**

### **Initialize a New Repository**

To create a new Git repository:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Initialize the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This creates a `.git` folder in your directory, which stores all version control information.

### **Add Files to Staging**

Add files to the staging area (prepare them for commit):

```bash
git add <file_name>  # Add a specific file
git add .            # Add all changes in the current directory
```

### **Commit Changes**

Create a snapshot of your staged changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

**Tip:** Use clear, concise commit messages that describe what you changed.

### **Connect to a Remote Repository**

To link your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub):

```bash
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```

Verify the remote connection:

```bash
git remote -v
```

### **Push Changes to a Remote Repository**

Push your commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main  # Push the current branch and set upstream
```

### **Pull Changes from a Remote Repository**

Update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### **Clone an Existing Repository**

Copy an existing repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

This creates a new directory containing the repository.

---

## **Branching and Merging**

Branches allow you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

### **Create a New Branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature_branch
```

This creates and switches to a new branch named `feature_branch`.

### **Switch Between Branches**

```bash
git checkout main
```

Switch to an existing branch.

### **Merge Branches**

To merge changes from one branch into another:

1. Switch to the target branch (e.g., `main`):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature_branch
   ```

**Tip:** Resolve any merge conflicts manually, then stage and commit the resolved files.

## **Common Git Commands Cheat Sheet**

| Command                        | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `git status`                   | Show the status of your working directory    |
| `git log`                      | View commit history                          |
| `git diff`                     | Show changes not yet staged                  |
| `git branch`                   | List all branches in the repository          |
| `git stash`                    | Temporarily save changes without committing  |
| `git rebase branch_name`       | Reapply commits from one branch onto another |
| `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Tag msg"` | Create an annotated tag                      |

## **Best Practices**

1. **Commit Often:** Make small, logical commits with meaningful messages.
2. **Branching:** Use branches for features, fixes, and experiments. Keep `main` or `master` clean and deployable.
3. **Code Reviews:** Push changes to remote branches and create pull requests for review.
4. **Document Workflow:** Define naming conventions for branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`) and commits.
5. **Avoid Large Commits:** Commit only related changes in a single commit.
6. **Pull Before Push:** Always pull the latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts.
