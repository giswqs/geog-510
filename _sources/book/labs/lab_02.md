   - Links to your social media profiles.
   - An image or logo.
   - Any additional content youâ€™d like to showcase.
5. **Commit and push your changes to the remote repository:**
6. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to deploy your site.
7. Visit `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io` to see your site live.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** Check out this GitHub Pages site for inspiration: <https://giswqs.github.io>

## Exercise 3: Contribute to an Open-Source Project on GitHub

1. **Find an open-source project** that interests you. If you donâ€™t know where to start, try this repository: <https://github.com/giswqs/geog510-demo>.
2. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
3. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
4. **Make improvements**, such as:
   - Fixing typos or grammatical errors in documentation.
   - Adding a new Python script, Jupyter Notebook, or Markdown file.
   - Fixing bugs or enhancing existing code.
5. **Commit and push your changes** to your forked repository.
6. **Create a pull request (PR)** to the original repository, explaining your changes.
7. Wait for the project maintainer to review and merge your PR.

## Exercise 4: Add a Colab Badge to a Jupyter Notebook

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** or use an existing one.
2. **Add a Jupyter Notebook** to the repository.
3. **Insert a Colab badge** at the top of the notebook using this Markdown snippet:
   ```markdown
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/blob/BRANCH/PATH_TO_NOTEBOOK.ipynb)
   ```
4. Replace `USERNAME`, `REPOSITORY`, `BRANCH`, and `PATH_TO_NOTEBOOK` with the correct values for your notebook.
5. **Add content** to the notebook (e.g., text, code cells, outputs).
6. **Commit and push your changes** to the remote repository.
7. **Test the Colab badge** by clicking it in your GitHub repository and verifying that it opens in Google Colab.
