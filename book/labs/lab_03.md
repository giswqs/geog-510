# Lab 3

This lab guides you through the process of creating, setting up, documenting, and publishing a Python package for geospatial applications. By the end of this lab, you will have a structured package with version control, automated checks, and online documentation.

## Exercise 1: Create a Python Package Using Cookiecutter

**Objective:**
Generate a well-structured Python package using a standardized template.

**Instructions:**

1. Install Cookiecutter if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install cookiecutter bump-my-version
   ```
2. Use the following template to create your package:
   ```bash
   cookiecutter gh:opengeos/cookiecutter-pypackage
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to customize your package.
4. Create a new repository on GitHub and push your package code to it.

## Exercise 2: Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks

**Objective:**
Automate code quality checks using pre-commit hooks to enforce best practices.

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to https://pre-commit.ci and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Add your package repository to pre-commit.ci.
3. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your repository or use an example configuration:
   [Example Pre-Commit Config](https://github.com/giswqs/geodev/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
4. Install the pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
5. Test the hooks by running:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
6. Commit the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file and push it to GitHub.

## Exercise 3: Enable MkDocs for Documentation

**Objective:**
Set up an online documentation site for your package using MkDocs. The cookiecutter template already includes MkDocs, so you can start writing documentation right away.

**Instructions:**

1. Install required packages for documentation:
   ```bash
   cd YOUR-PACKAGE-REPO
   conda activate YOUR-ENV-NAME
   pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
   ```
2. Update Markdown files in the `docs/` directory.
3. Serve the documentation locally:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
5. Enable GitHub Pages and use the `gh-pages` branch for the source.

## Exercise 4: Make a GitHub Release and Publish on PyPI

**Objective:**
Create a package release and distribute it to PyPI.

**Instructions:**

1. Bump the package version using `bump-my-version`:
   ```bash
   bump-my-version bump patch/minor/major
   ```
2. Commit the version change and push it to GitHub.
   ```
   git push
   git push --tags
   ```
3. Create a GitHub release:
   - Go to the "Releases" tab on GitHub.
   - Click "Draft a new release."
   - Select the tag version from the dropdown.
   - Click "Generate release notes."
   - Click "Publish release."
4. Make sure your package is automatically published on PyPI using GitHub Actions.

## Summary

In this lab, you have:

âœ… Created a Python package using Cookiecutter

âœ… Set up pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks

âœ… Enabled MkDocs for documentation

âœ… Released and published your package on PyPI

Now, your package is ready for distribution and use by the geospatial community! ðŸš€
